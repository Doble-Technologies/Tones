# Welcome to Tones ðŸ‘‹

This is a new project, directed to create an app that is new, innovative, and works efficiently to alert first responders of their new tone dropping for alarms. The app is directed toward volunteer agencies specifically in both Fire Department and EMS fields. The app is currently in development and will hope to reach alpha by end of 2024.
